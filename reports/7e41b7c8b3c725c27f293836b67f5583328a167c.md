- Simplify individual pages to basic contact management:
  - Clients page: Simple client directory with basic contact cards
  - Contractors page: Simple contractor directory with basic contact cards

- Streamline contact cards to essential information:
  - Name, company, phone, email
  - Simple 'Client', 'Contractor', or 'Consultant' badges
  - Basic Edit/Delete actions
  - Clean, focused interface without complex features

- Maintain navigation and search functionality:
