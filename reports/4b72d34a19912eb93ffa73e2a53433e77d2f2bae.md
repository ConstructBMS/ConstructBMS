**Commit message:** Disable ALL CSS smooth scrolling globally to fix drag-to-scroll

- Change all scroll-behavior: smooth to scroll-behavior: auto !important in index.css
- Use direct scrollLeft manipulation instead of scrollBy/scrollTo
- Remove all CSS smooth scrolling interference from html, body, main, and * selectors
- This should completely eliminate CSS smooth scrolling that was overriding JavaScript scroll speed
- Now drag-to-scroll should be much faster without any CSS interference
