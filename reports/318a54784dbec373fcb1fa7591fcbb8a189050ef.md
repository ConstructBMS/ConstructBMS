**Branch:** main
**Author:** Napwood Construction Ltd <napwoodconstruction@users.noreply.github.com>
**Commit message:** fix: make contact sub-pages read from main contacts store with proper filtering

- ClientsPage: Now reads from main contacts store, filters for clients only
- ContractorsPage: Now reads from main contacts store, filters for contractors only
- ConsultantsPage: Now reads from main contacts store, filters for consultants only

- Each sub-page now:
  - Uses useContactsStore() to access shared data
  - Filters contacts/companies by category (client/contractor/consultant)
  - Displays only their specific contact type
  - Maintains unique layouts and specialized information
  - Uses proper TypeScript type checking for Contact vs Company

- Fixed type issues:
  - Proper handling of Contact vs Company type differences
  - Safe property access using 'in' operator
  - Correct type detection for delete operations

- Maintained unique page characteristics:
  - Different color schemes and themes
  - Specialized statistics and metrics
  - Mock data for fields not in base contact types
  - Unique layouts and information display

- Data flow now correct:
  - Main CRM page: Shows all contact types with filtering
  - Sub-pages: Show only their specific contact type from same data source
  - No more independent data - all pages share the same contacts store
  - Proper filtering instead of separate data sets
